# Roles and permissions

**Status: CURRENT**

FloCafe currently has five fixed staff roles: owner, manager, cashier, server, and chef. This document describes the default role boundaries in the application. It is a read-only reference - it does not configure access.

The same read-only matrix is available in the Staff page for owners and managers. The runtime source of truth is [`shared/role-permissions.ts`](../shared/role-permissions.ts): backend route gates use its `ROLE_ACCESS` groups, and the in-app table is generated from its `PERMISSION_CAPABILITIES` list. This means the displayed matrix stays accurate when a route changes **if the route and capability are updated to use the shared constants**; it is not a separate database or IAM policy.

## Permission matrix

A check means the role is allowed to use the capability. A dash means it is not allowed. The table groups capabilities by area and uses the same capabilities shown in Staff > Role permissions.

## Important scope notes

- **Read-only display:** The in-app table does not offer role editing, permission toggles, or IAM configuration. These permissions are currently fixed by role. Role configuration/IAM is not available yet.
- **Owner and manager visibility:** The matrix is rendered only for an authenticated owner or manager on the Staff page. The API continues to enforce authorization independently; hiding a UI control is not a security boundary.
- **KDS scope:** Chef access is further narrowed by assigned `category_ids` and kitchen stations. Owner and manager KDS access is unrestricted by category, subject to the KDS being enabled.
- **Server App:** The standalone Server App is intentionally restricted to `server`, `manager`, and `owner` roles. It is separate from the dashboard navigation.
- **Staff management:** Managers can manage operational staff, but cannot modify or deactivate owner/manager accounts. Only owners can change roles for an existing account, and the last active owner cannot be demoted.
- **Conditional surfaces:** Business type, feature settings (such as KDS or WhatsApp), and account state can hide or disable a surface without changing the fixed role boundary.
- **Expense records are append-only:** Any staff member can record an expense or a due payment against an existing category, but no role — including owner — can edit or delete an individual expense/payment entry once recorded; it is a permanent audit trail. Only the expense *category* itself can be deleted (owner/manager only, and only once its due balance is settled).
- **Cash Counter's expected-cash figure cannot be overridden:** the daily/monthly expected cash total is always calculated (opening float + cash collected from orders − cash paid out as expenses); no role can edit or replace it. Staff can log an opening float (once per day) and any number of physical cash counts, both append-only, purely as reference facts compared against the calculated figure — never a substitute for it.

## Research-backed presentation choice

The in-app version uses roles as columns and capabilities as rows, with grouped areas, a semantic HTML table, explicit Allowed/Not allowed text paired with check/dash icons, and horizontal overflow with a sticky capability column. This keeps cross-role comparison fast while preserving table semantics and context at narrow desktop widths. The pattern follows [W3C table guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/), [GOV.UK table guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/table/), and [WCAG guidance on non-color state indicators](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html).
